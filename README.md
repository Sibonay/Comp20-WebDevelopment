#This Github repo holds the individual assignments I did for my Comp 20 (Web Development) class, which I took in Spring 2015 at Tufts University

#What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
 - My favourite assignment was actually the first one, in which I created my personal website. I enjoyed this assignment so much because I was quite involved in the visual arts in high school, and getting to apply my art background to something technical yet immediately tangible was gratifying.

#How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
- I'm constantly amazed by how much I can learn in a semester in a CS class! I came in knowing absolutely nothing; I had never even seen HTML and CSS before, and I had only taken the introductory CS class at Tufts. Now, although I know I have only skimmed the surface of web development, I feel like I have enough knowledge of its various components to delve deep into it and become a highly proficient web developer. I have a decent grasp of both front end and back end concepts, and I know how the client and server work together in web applications. 

#What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
- This course gave me an insight into distributed systems and their importance in basically all real world web development work. In my serverside code, I had to combine multiple backend APIs/systems to get my server running (e.g. Express Heroku, MongoDB). I also learned a lot about the black box model when writing clientside code for Assignment 2 and for my group project, as I knew what I had to send to the server and what I should've been getting back, but did not know how the backend was actually implemented.
- Most importantly, I learned how to learn by myself. I learned how to search for answers either online or from peers instead of relying on my lectures to provide all the information I needed to know. (I have noticed a gradual shift in my Facebook ads so that at least a quarter of them now relate to CS, for which I blame my numerous Stack Overflow searches).

#Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
- There are so many things I want to explore! First of all, I want to become awesome at front end. I was quite proud of my personal website when I first made it, yet even then, I realised it wasn't responsive at all (although I wasn't even introduced to the term "responsive design" until a week after I submitted it). I want to become a master of CSS and Javascript/jQuery, and I want to learn more about UI overall (and perhaps get into mobile app development)
- I also would like to learn more about security and internet distributed systems
- While I have enjoyed front end more than back end so far, I would like to become a proficient full stack developer, and so I hope to learn more about effective server-side programming (to start with, I want to learn other languages besides NodeJS and also learn about different database systems, etc.)
